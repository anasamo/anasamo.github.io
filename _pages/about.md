I am a Masters Student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Ali Anwar](httpsL//chalianwar.github.io). Before my Master's, I also completed my B.S in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. 

My research interests are in optimizing systems for ML, with a focus on efficiency and scalability. I enjoy working on problems where algorithmic techniques meet system-level challenges, especially involving trade-offs and finding optimal solutions. My current work focuses on system-level optimizations for multi-agent coordination.
