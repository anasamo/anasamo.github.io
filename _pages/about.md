My name Jinsheng Ba (巴金声 in chinese). I am currently a PhD candidate in [TEST Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) at National University of Singapore ([NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/)), and fortunate to be advised by Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). I am broadly interesetd in computer security (e.g., CTF, threat intelligence, reverse engineering, and malware detection). More recently, I focus on software testing via fuzzing.
