I am an M.S Student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Ali Anwar](httpsL//chalianwar.github.io) in the Distributed Machine Learning and Systems Lab. Before my Master's, I also completed my B.S in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota in December 2024. My research interests are in designing and optimizing scalable systems for machine learning.
